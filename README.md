 ## Project: Interactive Quiz Application
This project is a simple and engaging quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create an interactive web app where users can answer multiple-choice questions and get instant feedback.

When the user selects an answer, the app immediately shows whether itâ€™s correct or wrong, and provides visual feedback using colors. Each question is displayed one at a time, and users can move to the next question using a "Next" button. At the end of the quiz, a final message is shown with an option to restart the quiz.

The interface is clean and responsive, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. This project helped me understand core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and array iteration.

Key Highlights:
Clean and responsive UI

Instant feedback on each answer

Easy navigation between questions

Option to restart the quiz after finishing
